# ZeroGPU (WIP)
A CPU-Based software renderer for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Zero "dedicated" GPU!

# About 
- I made this project to learn more about the OpenGL, DirectX, and Vulkan Graphics Pipeline. 
- Despite the name, the PI Zero 2 W is just the platform this software will be developed on. Theoretically, you could run this renderer on anything from a powerful desktop to a Samsung Smart Fridge. I'm not your boss.
- Think of this less of a hardware project, and more of a "can we make a microcontroller optimized version of OpenGL?"
