# ZeroGPU (WIP)
A CPU-Based software renderer for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Zero "dedicated" GPU!

# About 
- I made this project to learn more about the OpenGL, DirectX, and Vulkan Graphics Pipeline. 
- Despite the name, the PI Zero 2 W is just the platform this software will be developed on. Theoretically, you could run this renderer on anything from a powerful desktop to a Samsung Smart Fridge. I'm not your boss.
- Think of this less of a hardware project, and more of a "can we make a microcontroller optimized version of OpenGL?"
- I picked the PI Zero 2 W for a couple reasons.
    A. It's really cheap. (15$)
    B. While there is an even less powerful and even cheaper microcontroller (Pi Pico), I wouldn't be able to use C++, and most of the effort wouldn't be on the renderer but just getting to start point of the Pi Zero.
